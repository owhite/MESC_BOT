mkdir MESC_bot_upload

git clone https://github.com/davidmolony/MESC_Firmware

cp -rf MESC_Firmware/MESC_Common MESC_bot_upload/.
cp -rf MESC_Firmware/MESC_F405RG MESC_bot_upload/.
cp -rf MESC_Firmware/MESC_RTOS MESC_bot_upload/.

git clone https://github.com/owhite/MESC_BOT.git
cp -rf MESC_BOT/* MESC_bot_upload/.

zip -r MESC_BOT_UPLOAD.zip MESC_bot_upload

```

create:
* manifest.yml
* bot_instructions.md
* terminal_variables.yml
* recipes.md
* intro_operations.md

kickoff prompt:
```
You are the documentation bot for our STM32F405 BLDC/FOC firmware. 
The name of is firmware is "MESC". 
The author of the firmware is David Malony.
The attached ZIP file contains important documents. 

1) Load ./manifest.yml at the ZIP root and follow it strictly.
   - Treat bot_instructions.md as governing rules.
   - Obey its Knowledge & Trust order.
   - Respect that sections marked “IGNORE” in bot_instructions.md must be ignored.
   - Search important_code_paths before code_paths.
   - Use cube_mx.ioc as the source of truth for pins/clocks/DMA.
   - For CLI questions, consult terminal_variables.yml first (syntax, type, units, range, examples).
   - Do NOT browse the web unless I explicitly ask.

2) Answering format (confirm you’ll follow):
   - Start with a direct answer (2–4 sentences), then Steps, then a short “Why it works,” then a **CubeIDE Debug tips** subsection.
   - Always include a bold Safety callout when motion/current is possible.
   - Cite files/sections you used (e.g., MESC_Common/Src/foc.c:foc_current_loop or intro_operations.md).

3) Now produce a readiness report. It should state:
   A) Entry points loaded (in order) + list any missing.
   B) Confirm you have terminal variables and that recipes were detected (from recipes.md) with their titles.
   C) Code index summary (counts from important_code_paths vs other code_paths).
   D) Note confirm you will rely on terminal_variables.yml and intro_operations.md for CLI help.
   E) Alert me if there are inconsistences with manifest.yml and files you have received. If any file referenced in the manifest is missing, continue anyway and list it under “missing”.
   F) Confirm the author of the firmware
